    My journey with the Students as Partners Program (SaPP) began in the early days of September when I was desperately searching for work.
    <br>
    <br>
    As an international student, my university fees had just been hiked. My father had taken a pay cut and I had earned a small stipend in Indian rupees,
    which amounted to barely CAD300, working as a business media intern. In my first year, I had spent a lot of time getting to know my professors and
    building relationships with them. That bore fruit this year, when I reached out to all of them to ask if they needed a Student Partner for Winter 2021.
    My Environmental Studies professor, David Hugill, flooded his department's mailing list with an email asking other faculty members if they had any available
    opportunities. And then I met Professor Dipto Sarkar, now my faculty partner for this project. <br>
    <br>
    Both of us have an Indian background, so we were able to get along on the cultural front. Otherwise too, it was easy to relate to Dipto and start learning
    from him. GIS seemed like something that was missing from my life given my love of data. Dipto not only told me about the specific GIS in his course,
    but also showed me how I could apply it to my program, journalism. I had never given a second thought to the interactive maps in The New York Times'
    articles, but suddenly it all made sense. <br>
    <br>
    In our first meeting, Dipto and I spoke about what GEOG4001 would entail, what I could assist with and what both of us could learn from each other. We also drafted
    the application for the program. Our teamwork was proving to be efficient. Later, I looked over the initial setup instructions for the course and built
    my GitHub front portfolio. Now, I'm developing this blog on Atom, something I wish I'd known about much earlier in my life.
    The best part about coding is how organized it is, just like mathematics. I'm grateful to have had this opportunity and also to be able to learn so much
    in such a short period of time. Stay tuned for more updates on this topsy-turvy journey! There is more adventure to come.

  November 2, 2020: Mapbox, blogging and a confused student

  </div>

    The biggest irony of being a journalist learning how to code is unlearning the use of punctuation. <br> <br>

    Over the course of the past 2 weeks, I have worked with Dipto to tackle the first assignment for his course: an interactive map created with Mapbox.
    Dipto has been incredibly resourceful and helpful, providing me with tools to learn at every stage where I find myself stuck. I often get stuck when
    I see unfamiliar language or code, but that is the essence of learning: diving into the unknown without an oxygen tank. So I started learning, and with
    Dipto's help converting shapefiles into geoJSON's and moving through the assignment instructions, I managed to develop a map using Mapbox. <br> <br>
    I used my home state Odisha's geographical data and interesting water table data to create a map. It shows points that are surrounded by abundant water
    sources but are hotspots of scarcity themselves. I used polygons from a Odisha districts file which Dipto sourced for me, and line and point files which
    the government of Odisha had available. Find my map <a href="index2.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. <br> <br>
    The next thing I want to address in this reflection is the amount of time it has taken me to develop these simple things. The webpage for these blog-like
    updates has taken me until now to develop and add content to, but it is so easy. This is especially useful as I progress to publishing my own blog without
    using a pre-existing software, so I can customize it the way I like it. In fact, I can add as much punctuation as I want because I won't be writing news on
    there. <br> <br>
    I find it quite amusing that journalists are told to avoid semi-colons like the plague but Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, is practically impossible without
    their use. Indeed, this is a challenging project which is training me in skills that I will use at the back-end of my career as a journalist, hopefully a
    multimedia journalist, while avoiding semi-colons in my newswriting. Now, the reason why I mentioned 'confused student' in the title for this segment is because
    confusion to me is often a catalyst to learn and do more work. It took me some time to organize this webpage into rows of table (can you believe it?) instead of
    boxes. This was Dipto's pro tip! So my confusion with tr tags and td tags forced me to spend some time on <a href="w3schools.com"> w3schools.com</a> learning how
    to do basic HTML and CSS. My next challenge which I am not even confused but rather baffled by, is Javascript to make my map even better. Let's see how it goes!

  November 23, 2020: One down, two to go, and the challenges of JS

    It took a month. Dipto (with his extensive knowledge of coding) and I (with my fledgling knowledge of code) took a month, collectively, to complete Assignment 1.
    It is through mental challenges and opportunities for learning that the SaPP program becomes especially enriching for students like myself, who are in a field completely
    different than their own. <br>
    My code was working just fine until the first chapter (look at me using technical .js terms!). After days brainstorming and de-bugging, Dipto found a missing comma and an
    extra bracket that was causing the issues. Once those were gone, the map worked just fine. It could definitely be prettier, but the technicality here is more important than
    the aesthetics of the map-not that the map looks bad. <br>
    After the map was ready, I had to integrate it into my website/front-facing portfolio. In that, I was once again stuck. But based on my learning thus far, I decided to try
    finding a solution myself rather than email Dipto right away. So I did. After exploring some websites and consulting my brother, I realized the simplest solution was to
    rename the story.js and its corresponding index.html file such that they could be in the same folder as my website's files. Perhaps there is a better way to organize
    these files, but that's for another time. <br>
    <br>
    I'm proud of this achievement, but there is a long way to go. There is more to learn and there are two assignments to get through before the SaPP term ends. I am confident
    that even if Dipto and I are unable to test those assignments in time, we will both have gained value through this term. For Dipto, I believe the value lays in learning
    which assignments work and which need tweaking. The challenge there is that my level of knowledge in coding is very different from that of his students. My level is lower,
    and that is probably better for Dipto to make the assignment descriptions, for instance, comprehensive and accessible to all.
