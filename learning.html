    My journey with the Students as Partners Program (SaPP) began in the early days of September when I was desperately searching for work.
    <br>
    <br>
    As an international student, my university fees had just been hiked. My father had taken a pay cut and I had earned a small stipend in Indian rupees,
    which amounted to barely CAD300, working as a business media intern. In my first year, I had spent a lot of time getting to know my professors and
    building relationships with them. That bore fruit this year, when I reached out to all of them to ask if they needed a Student Partner for Winter 2021.
    My Environmental Studies professor, David Hugill, flooded his department's mailing list with an email asking other faculty members if they had any available
    opportunities. And then I met Professor Dipto Sarkar, now my faculty partner for this project. <br>
    <br>
    Both of us have an Indian background, so we were able to get along on the cultural front. Otherwise too, it was easy to relate to Dipto and start learning
    from him. GIS seemed like something that was missing from my life given my love of data. Dipto not only told me about the specific GIS in his course,
    but also showed me how I could apply it to my program, journalism. I had never given a second thought to the interactive maps in The New York Times'
    articles, but suddenly it all made sense. <br>
    <br>
    In our first meeting, Dipto and I spoke about what GEOG4001 would entail, what I could assist with and what both of us could learn from each other. We also drafted
    the application for the program. Our teamwork was proving to be efficient. Later, I looked over the initial setup instructions for the course and built
    my GitHub front portfolio. Now, I'm developing this blog on Atom, something I wish I'd known about much earlier in my life.
    The best part about coding is how organized it is, just like mathematics. I'm grateful to have had this opportunity and also to be able to learn so much
    in such a short period of time. Stay tuned for more updates on this topsy-turvy journey! There is more adventure to come.

  November 2, 2020: Mapbox, blogging and a confused student

  </div>

</tr>
<tr>

  <div class="content2">
    The biggest irony of being a journalist learning how to code is unlearning the use of punctuation. <br> <br>

    Over the course of the past 2 weeks, I have worked with Dipto to tackle the first assignment for his course: an interactive map created with Mapbox.
    Dipto has been incredibly resourceful and helpful, providing me with tools to learn at every stage where I find myself stuck. I often get stuck when
    I see unfamiliar language or code, but that is the essence of learning: diving into the unknown without an oxygen tank. So I started learning, and with
    Dipto's help converting shapefiles into geoJSON's and moving through the assignment instructions, I managed to develop a map using Mapbox. <br> <br>
    I used my home state Odisha's geographical data and interesting water table data to create a map. It shows points that are surrounded by abundant water
    sources but are hotspots of scarcity themselves. I used polygons from a Odisha districts file which Dipto sourced for me, and line and point files which
    the government of Odisha had available. Find my map <a href="assignmentmap.html" target="_blank" onclick="window.open('assignmentmap.html', '_self');"> here</a>. <br> <br>
    The next thing I want to address in this reflection is the amount of time it has taken me to develop these simple things. The webpage for these blog-like
    updates has taken me until now to develop and add content to, but it is so easy. This is especially useful as I progress to publishing my own blog without
    using a pre-existing software, so I can customize it the way I like it. In fact, I can add as much punctuation as I want because I won't be writing news on
    there. <br> <br>
    I find it quite amusing that journalists are told to avoid semi-colons like the plague but Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, is practically impossible without
    their use. Indeed, this is a challenging project which is training me in skills that I will use at the back-end of my career as a journalist, hopefully a
    multimedia journalist, while avoiding semi-colons in my newswriting. Now, the reason why I mentioned 'confused student' in the title for this segment is because
    confusion to me is often a catalyst to learn and do more work. It took me some time to organize this webpage into rows of table (can you believe it?) instead of
    boxes. This was Dipto's pro tip! So my confusion with tr tags and td tags forced me to spend some time on <a href="w3schools.com" onclick="window.open('w3schools.com', '_self');"> w3schools.com</a> learning how
    to do basic HTML and CSS. My next challenge which I am not even confused but rather baffled by, is Javascript to make my map even better. Let's see how it goes!

  November 23, 2020: One down, two to go, and the challenges of JS

  </div>

</tr>
<tr>

  <div class="content3">
    It took a month. Dipto (with his extensive knowledge of coding) and I (with my fledgling knowledge of code) took a month, collectively, to complete Assignment 1.
    It is through mental challenges and opportunities for learning that the SaPP program becomes especially enriching for students like myself, who are in a field completely
    different than their own. <br>
    My code was working just fine until the first chapter (look at me using technical .js terms!). After days brainstorming and de-bugging, Dipto found a missing comma and an
    extra bracket that was causing the issues. Once those were gone, the map worked just fine. It could definitely be prettier, but the technicality here is more important than
    the aesthetics of the map-not that the map looks bad. <br>
    After the map was ready, I had to integrate it into my website/front-facing portfolio. In that, I was once again stuck. But based on my learning thus far, I decided to try
    finding a solution myself rather than email Dipto right away. So I did. After exploring some websites and consulting my brother, I realized the simplest solution was to
    rename the story.js and its corresponding index.html file such that they could be in the same folder as my website's files. Perhaps there is a better way to organize
    these files, but that's for another time. <br>
    <br>
    I'm proud of this achievement, but there is a long way to go. There is more to learn and there are two assignments to get through before the SaPP term ends. I am confident
    that even if Dipto and I are unable to test those assignments in time, we will both have gained value through this term. For Dipto, I believe the value lays in learning
    which assignments work and which need tweaking. The challenge there is that my level of knowledge in coding is very different from that of his students. My level is lower,
    and that is probably better for Dipto to make the assignment descriptions, for instance, comprehensive and accessible to all.

  December 1, 2020: Assignment 2

  <div class="content4">
    My struggle with coding and actually helping Dipto with his assignments is becoming a theme in these journals. Of course, that is a reflection of the truth. But, this entry is more
    to describe an application of learning from SaPP that I have applied outside school. I recently got hired as a volunteer staff writer at Spheres of Influence, which is an analytical
    journalism/international policy publication. Until now, they hadn't been using data or geospatial elements to complement their stories. In my interview, I mentioned using simple tools
    to make their articles more interactive for readers to stay hooked to them. I suggested Mapbox, something so complicated for beginners like myself, but so wonderful for people who are
    just looking at the visuals and learning from them. Dipto has taught me to make those maps and now I can teach others while also helping enhance a newly-formed not-for-profit. <br>
    Besides that, it is time to get started on the second assignment. School has been tectic and I've been finding it challenging to allot regular hours to work. Instead, I've been working
    4-5 hours at a stretch once in 3 days. However, those 4-5 hours do not yield as much as they would if I were actually building something rather than fixing what was going wrong. That's a
    part of being an amateur coder. Dipto reassures me that small steps too are useful to him, and I hope that that is true. We are going to start workign on Assignment 2, which builds on the
    first assignment but adds the elements of geocoding and automated data integration to the maps. I already know by the sound of it that it will be challenging but we've got this!

  December 18, 2020: Facing the truth: coding isn't easy and takes times to learn

  </div>

</tr>
<tr>

  <div class="content5">
    It's been a while since I wrote an entry in this log because I spent too much time trying to solve issues that Dipto's students will find easy to navigate when they
    do the second assignment. After doing everything, and a couple of meetings with Dipto, there has been little progress on my end because Dipto has developed all the JS
    code. All I have done is string together the elements. Still, as of today, the geocoding part of the assignment is not working. There is a single error and even with all
    the Scripts triggers in place, there is one error. It bothers me that I can't <i> really </i> help because Dipto is doing all the assignments himself too, AND he is
    doing them on my behalf too. I wish I knew more code coming into SaPP, but even though the term is drawing to an end, I've learned things. I just started learning Javascript
    today. There's a picture here of one of the modules I completed: <br>

    <img src ="/LearnJS.PNG" alt ="JS on Codecademy" style='width:1000px; height:500px;' class="center"> <br>

    I learned the JS function "console.log()" long after I asked Dipto what it was and he explained it to me. Now I know a few operators (mathematical ones), some methods, and
    objects. The terminology is still new, so I had to check back on Codecademy to make sure I was saying the right things. <br>
    Anyhow, with these few things, the challenge of assignment 2 just remains to get the geocoding working. Once that is done, the assignment should be done. Dipto and I don't
    think there will be enough time to complete Assignment 4, but I want to try it anyway so I can challenge myself and continue learning with practical applications. <br>
    It is this extreme reliability of mine on Dipto and my lack of knowledge of code that poses a challenge to this student-faculty partnership: despite Dipto's reassurances, I know that he has done a lot
    more work trying to teach me than I have done trying to aid him in beta-testing the projects for his class. I think in the remaining time we have, there is little I can do except for help with
    looking through things one last time, the instructions for the assignments, and perhaps the way they are presented. There isn't much to do though, again because of the difference in the level of
    expertise of his students in the topics of this class (4th year Geography/CS students) and me (2nd year journo). Plus, all the materials are already very clear so there isn't much more to do.
    We have a meeting later today. I'll post an update after that meeting.

        The meeting with Dipto went well! We had an honest conversation about what we achieved and what we will do from hereon.
          The first thing we did was adjust the second assignment to make sure everything worked. The two parts I was missing were:
      <ol>
        <li> A single space in an element such that a syntax error made the entire .setLngLat function redundant in the website </li>
        <li> The wrong address of the map style. Here, I had chosen to make an entirely new map and manually add points, whereas I should have simplified the code
              and used only a base map from Mapbox. Dipto sent me the code for this and I learned how to do it. </li>
      </ol>
          <br> The assignment works now. I have to add more things to the website to make it a standalone page. After that, I'm going to collate all the different pages to create one
          front-facing portfolio. The website, at the moment, looks something like the image on the right.
