  <p align="left"> My name is Lahari Nanda and I am a storyteller. I am a journalist, author, poet and a human. <br>
  Thus, I have a tendency to tell stories everyday, in different forms. We're all human (I think) and all of us tell stories everyday, in some capacity.

  Through this website, I'm telling my story in the form of code. My languages were HTML, some Javascript and a few splashes of markdown Git.
  How will you interpret the stories on this website?
