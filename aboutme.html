  <p align="left"> My name is Lahari Nanda and I am a storyteller. I am a journalist, author, poet and a human. <br>
  Thus, I have a tendency to tell stories everyday, in different forms. We're all human and all of us tell stories everyday, in some capacity. I started telling stories when 
    I was 6 years old, at creative writing competitions and as tales of fantastic worlds beyond that which we know of. Today, I tell the stories of people, places, and the amazing
    ways in which both intersect.
